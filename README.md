# Q&A
Can I ...
  
  Yes. You can do whatever you like, stuff here is licensed under MIT license so you can copy, modify, re-release, sell, send to mars, print and fold into origami frogs, whatever. I don't really care, in fact, having someone else maintain it would be win-win situation for me as I only made this stuff because I couldn't find existing solution to my problems. I don't bother licensing releases so you can consider them either Copyleft or MIT, whatever suits your needs.

Versioning
  
  Because stuff here is pretty much bound to specific version of World of Tanks I decided to just use game version for each release to make it easy on players. Of course when fuck-up happens a patch might be necessary, so in the end I ended up with versions like "1.4.0.1 v2" and such. If you want take over stuff here, it would be nice of you to keep this scheme so I'll have easy time finding correct version :)
  
THAT CODE IS HIDEOUS!
  
  Oh yes. It is horrible. Half of it is found in depths of internet, translated from C# translated to Visual Basic translated to C#, and then refactored to make it useable for my needs. Rest is quick and dirty trash code to glue basic GUI together. But it works, more or less.
